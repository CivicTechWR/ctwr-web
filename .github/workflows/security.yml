    # only bumps dependency versions and will not introduce committed secrets.
    # To also scan Dependabot PRs, add GITLEAKS_LICENSE as a Dependabot secret:
    # Settings → Secrets and variables → Dependabot → New secret.
    # Use PR author instead of github.actor: actor changes on manual re-runs,
    # which would cause the job to run again on a Dependabot PR and fail.
