## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**

Send an email to: **civictechwr@gmail.com**

Include the following information:
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### 3. **Use our PGP key** (optional)

For sensitive reports, you can encrypt your email using our PGP key:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key will be added here]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## üîç What We Consider a Security Vulnerability

### Critical Issues
- **Remote Code Execution** (RCE)
- **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting** (XSS) that can execute arbitrary code
- **Authentication bypass** vulnerabilities
- **Sensitive data exposure** (API keys, passwords, etc.)

### High Priority Issues
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery** (CSRF)
- **Server-Side Request Forgery** (SSRF)
- **Insecure direct object references**
- **Security misconfigurations**
- **Insecure deserialization**

### Medium Priority Issues
- **Information disclosure** (non-sensitive)
- **Denial of Service** (DoS) vulnerabilities
- **Insecure redirects**
- **Missing security headers**

### Low Priority Issues
- **Best practice violations**
- **Outdated dependencies** (non-critical)
- **Minor information leaks**

## ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **Initial response**: 24-48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

## üèÜ Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help us improve our security posture. Contributors who report valid security vulnerabilities will be:

- **Acknowledged** in our security advisories (if desired)
- **Listed** in our security hall of fame
- **Invited** to our community events
- **Recognized** in our release notes

## üîí Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **HTTPS enforcement** with HSTS headers
- **Content Security Policy** (CSP) implementation
- **Security headers** (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- **Dependency vulnerability** scanning
- **Regular security audits**
- **Secure coding practices**

### Security Headers

Our website implements the following security headers:

```apache
# Security Headers
Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://code.jquery.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self'; frame-src 'none'; object-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'"
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
Header always set X-Frame-Options "DENY"
Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
Header always set Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
Header always set Permissions-Policy "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()"
Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks

We run the following security checks on every commit:

- **Bundler Audit** for Ruby gem vulnerabilities
- **npm audit** for JavaScript package vulnerabilities
- **CodeQL** for static analysis
- **Dependency scanning** for known vulnerabilities

### Manual Security Reviews

- **Code reviews** for security issues
- **Penetration testing** (planned)
- **Third-party security audits** (planned)

## üìã Security Checklist
