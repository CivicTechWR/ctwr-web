# Alignment Refinement - "Close but Not Really"

## Problem Statement
The desktop alignment fixes were implemented but the user reports the alignment is "close but also not really" correct. There are still subtle alignment issues that need to be identified and fixed.

## Critical Constraint
⚠️ **DO NOT BREAK MOBILE**: Mobile layout (375px) must maintain no horizontal scroll and centered content.

## User Feedback Screenshots
The user provided 4 screenshots showing the current state:
1. Featured Projects section - cards and layout
2. Meeting section - image and info box on teal background
3. About section - text left, image right
4. Hero section - main landing area

User assessment: "close but also not really" - indicating subtle alignment issues remain.

## Investigation Required

### Deep Alignment Analysis Needed

For EACH section, you need to investigate and document:

#### 1. Featured Projects Section
**Current state**: Cards displayed in grid layout

**Check for**:
- Are the project cards truly aligned at their tops?
- Is the spacing between cards equal?
- Are the GitHub buttons aligned consistently across cards?
- Are the card images the same height or do they cause misalignment?
- Does the text content alignment within cards cause visual imbalance?
- Is the left column text ("Built by the Community") properly aligned with the card grid?

**Specific measurements to take**:
- Card heights (are they equal?)
- Spacing between cards (vertical and horizontal gaps)
- Button positions within cards
- Image heights within cards
- Alignment of card tops relative to each other

#### 2. Meeting Section
**Current state**: Teal background with image on left, info box on right

**Check for**:
- Is the meeting image vertically centered relative to the info box?
- Is there equal whitespace above and below the content?
- Does the info box align properly with the image?
- Are the icon + text rows within the info box aligned properly?
- Is the "More Details & RSVP" button positioned correctly?

**Specific measurements to take**:
- Image height vs info box height
- Vertical centering of both elements within the section
- Top/bottom margins of the section
- Icon alignment within the info box
- Button positioning

#### 3. About Section
**Current state**: Text on left, group photo on right

**Check for**:
- Is the text content vertically centered relative to the image?
- Is the heading aligned properly with the paragraph text?
- Does the image sit at the right vertical position relative to text?
- Is there visual balance between text column and image column?
- Is the "You can read more about our team here" link properly positioned?

**Specific measurements to take**:
- Text block height vs image height
- Vertical centering of both columns
- Alignment of heading and paragraph starts
- Link positioning
- Column width ratios

#### 4. Hero Section
**Current state**: Main landing area with heading and buttons

**Check for**:
- Is the hero content properly centered within its container?
- Are the buttons aligned properly (horizontally centered)?
- Is vertical spacing balanced?
- Does the "Welcome to CivicTechWR" badge align with the heading?
- Are decorative shapes properly positioned?

**Specific measurements to take**:
- Content centering within viewport
- Button group alignment
- Vertical spacing between elements
- Badge positioning relative to heading

## Common Alignment Issues to Look For

### 1. Flexbox Alignment Properties
Missing or incorrect:
- `align-items` (flex-start, center, stretch)
- `justify-content` (center, space-between, flex-start)
- `align-self` on individual items

### 2. Grid/Column Mismatches
- Unequal column widths when they should be equal
- Missing responsive column classes
- Bootstrap grid classes not properly applied

### 3. Padding/Margin Imbalances
- Unequal padding on left/right
- Inconsistent vertical spacing
- Negative margins not properly offset

### 4. Image Sizing Issues
- Images with different aspect ratios causing height differences
- Missing `object-fit` properties
- Images not respecting container constraints

### 5. Content Flow Problems
- Text wrapping differently causing height variations
- Line-height inconsistencies
- Font size differences affecting vertical rhythm

## Debugging Methodology

### Step 1: Visual Grid Analysis
For each section:
1. Take a screenshot
2. Use browser DevTools to overlay grid lines
3. Measure actual positions vs expected positions
4. Document discrepancies

### Step 2: Computed Style Inspection
For each problematic element:
```javascript
// Example inspection code
const element = document.querySelector('.selector');
const computed = window.getComputedStyle(element);
console.log({
  display: computed.display,
  flexDirection: computed.flexDirection,
  alignItems: computed.alignItems,
  justifyContent: computed.justifyContent,
  height: computed.height,
  paddingTop: computed.paddingTop,
  paddingBottom: computed.paddingBottom,
  marginTop: computed.marginTop,
  marginBottom: computed.marginBottom
});
```

### Step 3: Comparative Analysis
Compare working sections (like Hero) with problematic sections:
- What alignment properties do working sections use?
- What's different in the sections that look "off"?
- Can successful patterns be replicated?

### Step 4: Pixel-Perfect Measurements
Use browser DevTools to measure:
- Element heights
- Vertical positions from top of container
- Horizontal centering
- Spacing between elements

## Specific Test Breakpoints

Test at EACH of these widths and document what looks wrong:

- **1200px** (large desktop) - user's likely viewport
- **1400px** (extra large)
- **992px** (desktop)
- **768px** (tablet)
- **375px** (mobile - must not break!)

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Detailed Analysis Report
For each section, document:
- What specifically looks misaligned
- Current CSS properties causing the issue
- Exact measurements showing the problem
- Root cause explanation

### 2. Proposed Fixes
For each identified issue:
- Specific CSS changes needed
- Why this fix addresses the root cause
- Expected visual outcome

### 3. Implementation
- Apply fixes to HTML/CSS
- Rebuild main.css
- Deploy to _site
- Test at all breakpoints

### 4. Visual Verification
- Before/after screenshots at 1200px
- Before/after measurements
- Verification that mobile still works

## Files to Investigate

### HTML Sections
- `/index.html` - All sections mentioned
  - Hero section (lines ~50-90)
  - About section (lines ~120-145)
  - Hacknights section (lines ~160-190)
  - Projects section (lines ~195-245)
  - Meeting section (lines ~250-285)

### CSS Files
- `/css/components/hero.css` - Hero section styles
- `/css/components/meeting.css` - Meeting section
- `/css/components/projects.css` - Project cards
- `/css/pages/about.css` - About section
- `/css/bootstrap-custom.css` - Grid system
- `/css/main.css` - Compiled output

## Success Criteria

### Visual Goals
1. ✅ All images and text vertically centered within their sections
2. ✅ Project cards have equal heights and perfect top alignment
3. ✅ Meeting section image and info box perfectly balanced
4. ✅ About section text and image vertically centered
5. ✅ Hero section perfectly centered
6. ✅ Consistent spacing throughout all sections

### Technical Goals
1. ✅ Proper use of flexbox/grid alignment properties
2. ✅ Equal padding/margins where appropriate
3. ✅ Consistent image handling
4. ✅ No layout breaks at any breakpoint
5. ✅ Mobile remains perfect (no horizontal scroll)

## Agent Instructions

Work in: `/Users/andrelevesque/Projects/CTWR-Org/ctwr-web/`

**Your approach should be**:

1. **Systematic Investigation** (60 minutes)
   - Load site at 1200px viewport
   - Screenshot each section
   - Use DevTools to measure and inspect
   - Document exact issues found

2. **Root Cause Analysis** (30 minutes)
   - Identify CSS properties causing misalignment
   - Compare with working sections
   - Determine minimal fixes needed

3. **Implementation** (30 minutes)
   - Apply targeted CSS fixes
   - Rebuild and deploy
   - Test at all breakpoints

4. **Verification** (30 minutes)
   - Take after screenshots
   - Measure to verify corrections
   - Test mobile thoroughly
   - Document changes

**Be thorough**: The user said "close but not really" - this means subtle issues that require careful measurement and analysis, not obvious problems.

**Be precise**: Document exact pixel measurements showing before/after alignment.

**Be comprehensive**: Test every section at every breakpoint.

Report back with:
- Detailed findings of what was misaligned
- Exact fixes applied
- Before/after measurements proving corrections
- Verification that mobile remains intact
