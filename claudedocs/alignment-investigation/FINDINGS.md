# Alignment Investigation Findings - 1200px Viewport

## Summary
User reported alignment is "close but also not really" correct. Systematic investigation revealed 3 sections with significant alignment issues.

---

## Section 1: Hero Section ✅ CORRECT

### Measurements at 1200px:
- **Viewport center**: 600px
- **Container center**: 600px
- **Row center**: 600px
- **Hero text center**: 600px
- **Badge center**: 599.996px (~600px)
- **Title center**: 600px
- **Actions center**: 600px

### Status: **PERFECTLY ALIGNED** ✅
All elements are horizontally centered at viewport midpoint. No issues found.

## Section 2: About Section ❌ MISALIGNED

### Critical Issues Found:

#### 1. Vertical Misalignment (Primary Issue)
```
Text Column Top:  1223.34px
Image Column Top: 1377.02px
Difference:       -153.67px (text starts 153px HIGHER)
```

#### 2. Middle Alignment Off
```
Text Column Middle:  1580.92px
Image Column Middle: 1556.91px
Difference:          +24.00px (text middle 24px higher)
```

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis:
- **Row has `align-items: center`** ✅ (correct)
- **BUT text column has `margin-top: 48px`** ❌ (breaks centering)
- **Image column has `margin-top: 0px`** ✅ (correct)
- Result: The 48px top margin on text column pushes it up, breaking vertical alignment

#### 4. Additional Observations:
- Text column height: 715px
- Image column height: 360px
- Height difference: 355px (expected with different content)
- The issue is NOT height difference, it's the asymmetric margin

### Fix Required:
**Remove or equalize the `margin-top: 48px` on text column in About section**

## Section 3: Meeting Section ❌ MISALIGNED

### Critical Issues Found:

#### 1. Row Alignment Property Wrong
```
Current: align-items: stretch
Should be: align-items: center
```

#### 2. Column Vertical Misalignment
```
Col1 Top: 4428.42px (image side)
Col2 Top: 4476.42px (info box side)
Difference: -48px (col1 starts 48px HIGHER)
```

#### 3. Middle Alignment Off
```
Col1 Middle: 4708.44px
Col2 Middle: 4732.44px
Difference: -24px (col1 middle 24px higher)
```

#### 4. Root Cause Analysis:
- **Row uses `align-items: stretch`** ❌ (wrong - causes uneven stretching)
- **Should use `align-items: center`** to vertically center both columns
- Col1 height: 560px
- Col2 height: 512px
- Height difference: 48px (causes the misalignment with stretch)

### Fix Required:
**Change Meeting section row from `align-items: stretch` to `align-items: center`**

## Section 4: Featured Projects ❌ SEVERELY MISALIGNED

### Critical Issues Found:

#### 1. Card Top Position Variance
```
Card 0 Top: 3870.42px
Card 1 Top: 3184.85px
Card 2 Top: 3550.85px

Top Variance: 685.57px (HUGE misalignment!)
```

#### 2. Cards NOT Aligned at Tops
```
allTopsEqual: false
Cards are scattered vertically with no alignment
```

#### 3. Root Cause Analysis:
- **Row has `align-items: normal`** ❌ (allows cards to flow naturally without alignment)
- **Should use `align-items: start`** to align all cards at their tops
- All cards have equal heights (350px each) ✅
- But their starting positions are completely misaligned

#### 4. Layout Structure Issue:
The section uses a complex layout:
- Left column (col-lg-6): Text content + 1 project card below
- Right column (col-lg-6): 2 project cards stacked

This asymmetric layout is causing the misalignment because:
- Cards in right column start at top of their column
- Card in left column starts below the text content
- No grid alignment between the columns

### Fix Required:
**Change Projects section row to `align-items: start` for top alignment**
**Consider restructuring the layout for better visual balance**

## Priority Summary

### High Priority (Breaks Visual Harmony):
1. **Projects Section**: 685px card misalignment - most noticeable issue
2. **About Section**: 153px column misalignment - clearly visible
3. **Meeting Section**: 48px column misalignment - subtle but present

### CSS Files to Fix:
1. `/css/components/projects.css` - Fix row alignment
2. `/css/pages/about.css` - Remove asymmetric margin
3. `/css/components/meeting.css` - Change alignment property

## Testing Requirements

### Before/After Measurements:
- Document exact pixel measurements before fixes
- Verify measurements after fixes match expected values
- Take screenshots for visual comparison

### Breakpoint Testing (Critical):
Must test at ALL breakpoints after fixes:
- 1400px (extra large desktop)
- 1200px (large desktop) ← user's viewport
- 992px (desktop)
- 768px (tablet)
- **375px (mobile) ← CRITICAL: Must not break!**

### Mobile Verification:
- ✅ No horizontal scroll
- ✅ Content remains centered
- ✅ Sections maintain proper spacing
